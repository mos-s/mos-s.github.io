    Webaudio pitch deduction example from https://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/ 'Pitch Detection' view source.
    Got some errors (because of timing?)
        Uncaught DOMException: Unable to decode audio data
            name:'EncodingError'
                Because I did not have whistling3.ogg in place.
        Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getFloatTimeDomainData' of null
            presumably because analyser not created yet!
        On IOS get: TypeError: navigator:getUserMedia(dictionary, callback, arror) navigator:getUserMedia is undefined
            My pitchJS (streaming with base filter ex) uses: navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia ({audio: true, video: false})
    Note that had to use demo audio or oscillator before could use live input!
    
    Uses analyser - audioContext.createAnalyser() to get actual samples to draw wave - analyser.getFloatTimeDomainData( buf );
    Though sets analyser.fftSize it actually uses samples to do a primitive autocorrelation = autocorrelate( buf, sampleRate ).

    Also - see googEchoCancellation and other 'mandatory' audio vars!!
