DESCRIPTION


Shows capabilities of browser on current hardware eg AudioWokletNode, ShareArrayBuffer etc
Allows sound processing (basically dot product) using shaders! (based on examples at http://www.vizitsolutions.com/portfolio/webgl/gpgpu)
Uses AudioWorklet (or ScriptProcessor if not available) to collect wave, deduce pitch and show as solid circle (using pixi.js).
Does not currently use wasm.
Currently only recognises highish notes of recorder. (max wl is 512 sanples!)

GOAL
Process sound in js and/or wasm
Integrate babylon
	babylon and gpgpu poss?
Use ring buffer
Use workers	
Use shared memory if available. ?implemented?

IMPROVEMENTS
	SoundObject structure improve!?
	Final part of pitch computation in wasm
	Organise code. eg use folder 'webgl'?

CURRENT STATE
	2020_11_29 - 690hz sine wave being passed through 512 sample script processor. pitch rtn is called ok and results sent to console.
	2022_09_29 - works great for basic testing of a device ... would like to integrate webasm and maybe babylon (sprites?)
