DESCRIPTION

Uses ScriptProcessor (ie not AudioWorklet) to deduce pitch and show as solid circle.
Does not use wasm.
Currently only recognises highish notes of recorder.

GOALS
	Run on IOS (so need a version which uses script processor and not audioworklet)
	Fast dot product etc - do it in shader because SIMD not available.
	Final part of pitch computation in wasm
	Organise code. eg use folder 'webgl'?
