Use audioWorklet or scriptProcessor according to available.
Process sound in js and/or wasm
Integrate babylon
	babylon and gpgpu poss?
Use ring buffer
Use workers	
Use shared memory if available.
Compute pitch dot product with shader!

IMPROVEMENTS
	SoundObject structure improve!?
	Final part of pitch computation in wasm
	Organise code. eg use folder 'webgl'?
